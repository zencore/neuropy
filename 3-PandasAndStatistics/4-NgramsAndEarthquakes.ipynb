    "# Part 4: Merging Different datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets combine data from two different datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "- N-grams (which ever you would like to download)\n",
    "- The USGS earthquake datasets (file: eqs-years.csv)\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** the file *eqs-years-2.csv* is a cleaned version of the one we previously used, and contains on each line: \"YYYY,NumberOfQuakes\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In the same way we can merge two or more n-gram datasets with a custom column, we can also merge datasets from different sources:\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** strange things *may* happen if not all of the same years are present, but in this case it all works out OK (it automatically performs an inner join).\n",
    "\n",
    "## questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How has the usage of the word \"earthquake\" changed over the past 200 years? Create a plot of the usage of the word \"earthquake\" since 1800.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Create a plot of the number of earthques since 1917. (this should be easy by now, right ;) )\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Is there a correlation between the two? Merge the two datasets (using **pf.merge**, and have a look at the resulting scatterplot between the two. To find out how to make a **scatterplot**, check the **matplotlib gallery**.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Is the difference statistically significant (using the **stats** package?)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Bonus** Any other words we might want to include? Tremor, Tsunami?\n",
    "\n",
    "## hints: \n",
    "\n",
    "Documentation on how to make the plot look pretty can be found here:\n",
    "- http://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_api.html#matplotlib.pyplot.plot\n",
    "- http://matplotlib.org/gallery.html\n",
